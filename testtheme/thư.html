    <h5 style="color: red; font-size: 30px;"> Some rules for acc farm</h5>
   <p style="font-size: 20px;">1- Your farm account should not be < 15m with CH < 25 </p> <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The limit in kingdom 3027 is less than 20m and one must participate in fortification in kvk. If you can't, please migrate those CH25 because they burden the kingdom. You can still collect resources with a CH24 l (CH24  are currently not counted in matchmaking in kvk pairings).</p> <br>
    <p style="color: red; font-style: italic; "><u>Reason:</u></p>  
    <p><p style="font-size: 20px;">1- A farm account with a pow of over 15 million and a CH25  will be considered in the top 300 strongest in the kingdom. This affects the kingdom's total pow in KVK . Upgrading the  CH to level 25 is not recommended if the acc does not participate in consolidation in the KVK.</p> <br></p>
   <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 2- Farm accounts over 20 million and lv CH25  must be hidden or emigrated from the kingdom permanently before KVK6. This is mandatory, and they no longer need to participate in consolidation. If they reappear after KVK6, KVK registration will have to be postponed for another month to wait until they are hidden again, making KVK happen more easily.</p>
    <p style="color: red; font-style: italic; "><u> Why do I say the  CH25 > 20m pow must be hidden forever?  </u></p>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <ol style="font-size:20px;">
            1- having farm accounts that do not engage in fort making or barbarism and do not refill the account can cause great pressure on the kingdom. For farm accounts of around 20 million pows, they may not be able to reach the required fortress points and may not be able to get up to speed enough to train troops to the kingdom's requirements. So getting rid of farm accounts to add another strong player might be a better choice. <br>
       2- For the next seasons, it is possible that the farm account will not be accelerated enough to retrain soldiers sufficiently to meet the kingdom's requirements. Following the rules is necessary to ensure the kingdom's strength and effectiveness. <br>
